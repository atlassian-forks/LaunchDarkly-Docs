## Overview

This topic explains how to configure the LaunchDarkly IntelliJ IDEA plugin and use it to interact with feature flags from within IntelliJ integrated development environments (IDEs). 

Use this plugin with your favorite compatible products from JetBrains including IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, WebStorm, GoLand, and many others. A full compatibility list is available on the [JetBrains Marketplace's plugin listing](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/15159-launchdarkly).

With the extension, you can:

- Autocomplete feature flag keys
- View a tooltip with feature flag details when you hover over a flag key in your source code
- Open to specific feature flags in LaunchDarkly from your code editor
- View a list of feature flags and their settings in the LaunchDarkly tool window
- Update a flag's state, fallback value, and default off variation

## Installing the IntelliJ IDEA plugin

To install the IntelliJ IDEA plugin, visit the LaunchDarkly plugin on the [JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/15159-launchdarkly/versions) and download the version compatible with your IDE.

## Configuring the IntelliJ IDEA plugin

To configure the IntelliJ IDEA plugin, you must have a valid access token.

You can create a new access token on the [Authorization page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/authorization). The access token must have sufficient permissions to support the plugin's functionality. To be able to toggle flags from your IDE, the access token must be generated with a writer role. A reader role is sufficient for viewing flag information.

The following example policy allows read access to all projects and write access to the minimal set of fields the plugin is able to update:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="json"
  values={[
    { label: 'Example inline policy', value: 'json', },
  ]
}>

<CodeTabItem value="json">

```json
[
  {
    "effect": "allow",
    "actions": ["viewProject"],
    "resources": ["proj/*"]
  },
  {
    "effect": "allow",
    "actions": [
      "updateOn",
      "updateFallthrough",
      "updateOffVariation"
    ],
    "resources": ["proj/*:env/*:flag/*"]
  }
]
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

With your access token, you can finish configuring the LaunchDarkly extension in the "LaunchDarkly" menu option in the IntelliJ IDEA "Preferences" dialog.

You will need to grant IntelliJ IDEA access to system's default credential store. This is to securely store your access token with [IntelliJ's Credential Store API](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/persisting-sensitive-data.html). You can then provide your access token and select the project and environment associated with your IntelliJ IDEA project.

## Code references in the IntelliJ IDEA plugin

The LaunchDarkly IntelliJ IDEA plugin supports code references. Configuring aliases for projects with code references makes the hover card available wherever that alias is used. To learn more, read [Finding flag aliases](/home/code/code-references#finding-flag-aliases).
