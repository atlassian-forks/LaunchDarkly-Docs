## Overview

This topic explains how to use the debugger.

The debugger gives you real-time insight into the events your application is sending to LaunchDarkly, so you can ensure that you've set LaunchDarkly up correctly. Different types of events appear, in detail or in summary, depending on what you want to see.

## Using the debugger

The debugger shows you a real-time stream of events arriving in LaunchDarkly from your app. When you first open the debugger, it connects to the event stream to show events as they appear. Establishing the connection can take up to 30 seconds, but the debugger connection state updates to show you the connection process status. In high-volume environments, you may see sampled events, rather than 100% of events.

<CalloutDescription>

The debugger does not display events when it is not the active tab in your browser. Leave it open and visible to see events as they occur. If you need to click around in your app to generate events, open the app in a second window. The debugger will time out after 15 minutes of inactivity. You can prompt to keep loading events.

## Flag events

The debugger displays evaluation counts and variation breakdowns for each flag evaluated since you opened the debugger. Click on a flag or select it from the menu to access individual event information. The connection state for the "Flag events" tab indicates if events have occurred in your environment recently.

If your environment has not registered any events, the status updates to indicate that. If you see this status frequently, it may mean that you have configured your SDK incorrectly. To learn more, read [SDKs](/sdk).

If there is an issue connecting to the event stream, an error status appears. This may appear because of an internal error or network disruptions. The error state should self-resolve, but if it does not, refresh your browser.

Flag evaluation events display as a summary. This saves data load. To get detailed evaluation event information for a flag, select it and click **Debug**.

This temporarily enables detailed events for that flag. The events appear as they are received. View additional information, including the user attributes used for evaluation, by clicking on an individual event.

<CalloutDescription>

The minimum required version for each platform SDK to use `summary` events is:

- .NET: 5.0.0
- Go: 4.0.0
- Java: 4.0.0
- Node: 5.0.0
- Python: 6.0.0
- Ruby: 4.0.0
- Rust: 1.0.0-beta.1
- JavaScript: 2.0.0
- Android: 2.4.0
- iOS: 2.13.0
- PHP: The PHP SDK does not itself support `summary` events. However, when PHP is used with LD Relay, the LD Relay event forwarding mode has the ability to turn the events received from the PHP SDK into `summary` events. This requires that you are using PHP SDK version 3.1.0 or higher. If you are using LD Relay with PHP you will need to upgrade LD Relay to version 4.0.0 or higher. Other SDKs do not require an LD Relay update to use `summary` events.

### Filtering detailed events

You can view specific kinds of detailed events on the **Flag events** tab by filtering by user attributes, flag variations, or both.

To filter detailed events:

1. Select a flag from the **Find events by flag name or key** menu.
2. Click **Filter**.
3. Choose a standard or custom attribute to filter by from the **Add filter** menu:

4. Choose an attribute value from the **Select attribute value** menu.
5. Click **Add**.

Only events with matching attribute values now display on the **Debugger** dashboard.

To add additional attribute values to your filter, click on the attribute name and select the additional values from the menu. The dashboard displays only events that match all of the attribute values you selected:

To remove a filter, click on the attribute name you want to stop filtering by and choose "Clear filter."

To filter variations:

1. Select a flag from the **Find events by flag name or key** menu.
2. Click **Variation**.
3. Select a variation:

![The "Variation" menu with options displayed.](debugger-variation.png)

Only detailed events corresponding to the selected variation now show on the dashboard. You can also filter by multiple variations.

## User events

There are two types of user events that display in the debugger:

- **Identify** events are explicitly triggered by your application code
- **Index** events are automatically triggered by the LaunchDarkly SDK based on flag evaluations

Click on a user to see individual event information.

## Experimentation events

The Experimentation events tab only displays for customers who have Experimentation enabled. To learn more, read [Experimentation](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/experimentation).

Here is an image of the **Experimentation events** tab in the debugger:

![The Experimentation events tab.](debugger-connection-experimentation-tab.png)


There are three types of experiment events:

- **Click** events
- **Page view** events
- **Custom** events

These events correspond to the kind of metric that triggered the event.
