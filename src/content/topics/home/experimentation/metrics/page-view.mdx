## Overview

This topic explains how to create a page view metric for an experiment in LaunchDarkly.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Some metrics require the JavaScript or React SDK</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Page view metrics are only available on the JavaScript and React SDKs. If you do not use the JavaScript or React SDK and would like to track clicks or page views, use a custom conversion metric.

<CalloutTitle>Call <code>track</code> and <code>flush</code> when a user is redirected</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

SDKs send events at regular intervals, such as every five seconds. If a browser redirects a user to another page, any events that occurred between when the SDK last sent events and when browser redirected the user will be lost. To avoid this, call `track` and then `flush` when you know the browser will redirect a user to another page, such as on click.

## Creating page view metrics

Page view metrics track how often users see an element on a page hosted at a specific URL. Page view metrics must be used with either the JavaScript or React SDK.

For example, you might want to track how often customers view an item when its price is discounted different amounts.

To create a page view metric:

1. Follow steps 1-7 in [Creating click metrics](/home/experimentation/metrics/click) until you have configured the form up to the "Event information" section.
2. Click the **Event kind** menu and select "Page view":

3. Specify the type of **Target URL** you want to track behavior on. To learn about the different options for URL matching, read the table in [Creating click metrics](/home/experimentation/metrics/click).
4. (Optional) Click **Add additional URL** to track behavior on more than one URL.
5. Click **Save metric**.

After you create a metric, you can connect it to an experiment. To learn how, read [Building experiments](/home/experimentation/create#building-experiments).
