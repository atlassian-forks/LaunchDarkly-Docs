## Overview

This topic explains how to set up and configure an experiment in LaunchDarkly. It introduces the concepts of metrics, explains different metric types, and explains how metrics interact with feature flags to create experiments.

In LaunchDarkly, the combination of metrics and flags is an experiment. Experiments let you measure the effect of flags on users by mapping them to the metrics your team cares about.

## Understanding Experimentation

When a user performs a metric-tracked action in your application after they encounter a feature flag, the experiment logs an event.

For example, an experiment might show that users are more likely to convert by clicking "Checkout" when the checkout button is a certain color. The metric you would track is the number of times users click on the checkout button. You would connect the metric to a flag serving four variations, each of which is a different color for the button.

Configuring an experiment requires five steps:

1. [Creating a metric](#creating-metrics),
2. [Defining the experiment population](#defining-experiment-populations),
3. [Building an experiment](#building-experiments),
4. [Starting an experiment iteration](#starting-experiment-iterations), and
5. [Turning on the feature flag](#turning-on-feature-flags)

These steps are explained in detail below.

## Prerequisites

To use Experimentation, you must have the following prerequisites:

### Your SDKs must be configured to send events

All of your SDKs must send events. You may have disabled sending events to reduce your monthly active users (MAU). If so, you must re-enable it.

The all flags method sends events for some SDKs, but not others. For SDKs that do not send events with the all flags method, you must call the `variation` method instead. If you call the `variation` method, you must use the right `variation` type. To learn more, read [Evaluating flags](/sdk/features/evaluating).

### Your network must be allowed to send events

Your network must be allowed to send events to LaunchDarkly. Ensure that event streaming endpoints, `mobile.launchdarkly.com`, and `events.launchdarkly.com` are on your allow list.

### You must be using unique user keys

Your anonymous users must have their own unique user keys to use Experimentation. To learn more, read [Designating anonymous users](/sdk/features/user-config#designating-anonymous-users).

### You must configure the Relay Proxy to send events

You do not have to use the Relay Proxy to use Experimentation. However, if you do use the Relay Proxy, you must configure it to send events. To learn more, read [Configuring an SDK to use the Relay Proxy](/home/relay-proxy/using#configuring-an-sdk-to-use-the-relay-proxy).

## Creating metrics

Metrics are the measure against which you evaluate flag events. You can use metrics to track all kinds of things, from how often users access a URL to how long that URL takes to load a page.

After you create a metric, you can connect it to one or more feature flags. If users load a URL, click an element, or otherwise participate in the behavior the metric tracks, LaunchDarkly sends an event to your experiment.

You don't need to create a new metric for each new experiment. You can reuse existing metrics by connecting them to multiple flags, which allows you to compare how this metric fares across numerous flags. Similarly, a single flag can have more than one metric connected to it, which allows you to see how this flag performs against various measurements.

To learn how to create a new metric, read [Creating metrics](/home/experimentation/metrics/index).

## Defining experiment populations

You have the option to only include a subset of users in your experiments, which gives you accurate experiment results more quickly. This subset of users is called your "experiment population."

You can create a custom experiment population by selecting specific flag targeting rules to include in your active experiments.

For example, imagine you are testing alternate copy for your checkout button. You're currently targeting all your Canadian and US users with the `true` variation for the alternate button, which shows your new copy, but you only want to run an experiment measuring click conversions for users in the United States. To accomplish this, you select the user targeting rule that affects US-based users and de-select the rule that targets users in Canada.

You may want to refine your experiment population for any of the following reasons:

- To run targeted experiments for a subset of your flag-targeted users.
- To exclude user groups whose events you do not need to measure. For example, users affected by 'Default' rules.
- To reduce the volume of events an experiment generates in order to manage billing costs.

When making changes to ramp up or ramp down users in your variations, LaunchDarkly properly randomizes users and provides the configuration and guidance to prevent carryover bias. This method of managing your experiment population is called "audience allocation." To learn more, read [Allocating experiment populations](/home/experimentation/allocation).

## Building experiments

You can view all the experiments in your environment by clicking **Experiments** in the sidebar menu.

Here is an image of the Experiments dashboard:

### Building experiments from the dashboard

There are two ways to build experiments:

* From the **Experiments** dashboard, and
* From a flag's **Experimentation** tab.

To build an experiment from the **Experiments** dashboard:

1. Navigate to the **Experiments** dashboard.
2. Click **Create experiment**:

![The "Experiments" dashboard with the "Create experiment" button called out.](experiment-dashboard-new-callout.png)

The "Create experiment" panel appears.

3. Choose a flag from the **Select flag** menu.
4. Choose a metric from the **Connect metric** menu.
5. Choose a baseline variation from the **Select baseline** menu.
6. Click **Create experiment**. Your new experiment appears on the dashboard.
7. Navigate to the **Targeting** tab of the feature flag connected to your experiment.
8. Click the **graph** icon next to the rule you want to run an experiment on, and select “Run an experiment on this rule.”

![The "graph" icon with the "Run an experiment on this rule" option called out.](experiment-run-experiment-callout.png)

9. Enter the percentage of traffic for each variation you want to include in the experiment.
10. Select which variation you want LaunchDarkly to serve to the remaining population.
11. (Optional) To disable traffic variation reassignment, click **Advanced**, then check the **Keep users assigned to initial variation** checkbox. We strongly recommend leaving this box **unchecked**. To learn more, read [Understanding variation reassignment](/home/experimentation/allocation#understanding-variation-reassignment).

After you create an experiment, you must start a new iteration in every environment where you want it to run. To learn more, read [Starting experiment iterations](#starting-experiment-iterations).

### Building experiments using the experiment builder

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>The experiment builder is for Early Access Program customers only</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The experiment builder is limited to a subset of customers in LaunchDarkly's Early Access Program (EAP). If you want access to this feature, [join the EAP](http://launchdarkly.com/eap).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

<Details summary="Click to expand details on building experiments using the experiment builder">

To build an experiment using the experiment builder:

1. Navigate to the **Experiments** dashboard or the **Experimentation** tab of a flag.
2. Click **Create experiment**:

![The "Experiments" dashboard with the "Create experiment" button called out.](experiment-dashboard-new-callout.png)

3. Select a metric from the **Metric** menu.
4. Click **Next**.
5. Select a flag from the **Select flag** menu. You cannot select any flags that are already part of an experiment.
6. Click **Next**.
7. Enter the percentage of traffic for each variation you want to include in the experiment:

![The "Set audience allocation" dialog.](experiment-create-set-allocation.png)

8. Click **Finish**. You are returned to the **Experimentation** tab of the feature flag you included in the experiment.

After you create an experiment, you must start a new iteration in every environment where you want it to run. To learn how, read [Starting experiment iterations](#starting-experiment-iterations).

To learn how to update the audience allocation after you create an experiment, read [Managing experiment populations](/home/experimentation/lifecycle#managing-experiment-populations).

## Starting experiment iterations

After you create an experiment, you can start an experiment iteration in one or more environments. From a flag's **Experimentation** tab, click the **Start recording** button in every environment where you want to record data.

Experiment iterations allow you to record experiments in discrete blocks of time. To ensure accurate experiment results, when you make changes that impact an experiment’s audience or variations it is best practice to start a new iteration of the experiment.

To learn more about starting and stopping experiment iterations, read [The experiment lifecycle](/home/experimentation/lifecycle).

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Experiment settings are environment-specific</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

When you create an experiment, it appears in every environment in your project. However, the **Start recording** button only impacts the experiment in one environment at a time. If you want to start a new iteration of the experiment in multiple environments, you must click **Start recording** for each environment individually. For example, you might run an experiment in Staging to gather data internally before turning it on in Production to gather customer data.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

## Turning on feature flags

For an experiment to begin recording data, the flags connected to its metrics must be toggled on. To learn how, read [Turning flags on and off](/home/managing-flags/flag-toggle).
