## Overview

This topic explains how to build, start, and view workflows in LaunchDarkly. A workflow is a set of actions that you can schedule in advance to make changes to a feature flag.

## Using workflows

Workflows can automate some of the manual tasks required to manage a feature flag. These tasks often take place in stages. For example, a feature flag workflow that gradually releases a flag to more users might look like this:

Workflows support consistent release practices and let you automatically release a feature based on your release process.

### Prerequisites

To use workflows, you should understand the following features:

* [Approvals](/home/feature-workflows/approvals)
* [Scheduled flag changes](/home/feature-workflows/scheduled-changes)

## Setting up a workflow

You can set up two kinds of workflows. Progressive rollout workflows gradually increase the percentage of users targeted by a flag. Custom workflows manage a specific rollout process that you define.

### Building a progressive rollout workflow

To build a progressive rollout workflow:

1. Navigate to the flag dashboard and select the flag you want to create a workflow for.
2. Click on the **Workflows** tab.
3. Click **Create a workflow**, and then click **Progressive rollout**. 
4. Click **Next**.
5. Configure your progressive rollout:
  * Choose when to start the workflow.
  * Choose the default variation to roll out to users.
  * Choose how much to increase the percentage of the rollout, starting at 0%. This setting overwrites any previously-defined rollouts for the default variation, so you should check to ensure that the default variation will not be reduced.
  * Choose how frequently to increase the rollout percentage.
6. Click **Review workflow**. An overview of the workflow appears.
7. (Optional) Click the **edit** icon next to the title to edit the title.
8. (Optional) Click the **edit** icon next to "Add a description" to add a description.
9. (Optional) If you have an approvals process, you can remove the first "Schedule" step, add an approval step, and then re-add the schedule step.

If you have an approvals process, you can add an approval step to your workflow.

Here's how:

1. Click the **overflow menu** in the first first "Schedule" step.
2. Choose "Delete step." The **Request approval** and **Schedule date and time** options appear.
2. Click **Request approval**.
3. Click into the **Reviewers** menu and choose an approver.
4. Enter a description in the **Description** field.

You must add approval steps before you add schedule steps.

8. Click **Start workflow**.

For multivariate workflows, LaunchDarkly decreases and recalculates the variations that are not selected for the rollout. You should confirm the auto-calculated percentage rollouts and adjust them to your preferences if needed.

### Building a custom workflow

To build a custom workflow:

1. Navigate to the flag dashboard and select the flag you want to create a workflow for.
2. Click on the **Workflows** tab.
3. Click **Create a workflow**, and then click **Custom workflow**.
4. Click **Create workflow**.
5. (Optional) Click the **edit** icon next to the title to edit the title.
6. (Optional) Click the **edit** icon next to "Add a description" to add a description.
7. (Optional) If you have an approvals process, click **Request approval**.
  * Click into the **Reviewers** menu and choose an approver.
  * Enter a description in the **Description** field.
  * You must add approval steps before you add schedule steps. If you accidentally add a schedule step first, delete the schedule step, and then add the approval step as the first step of that stage.
8. If you don't need to request approval, click **Schedule date and time**.
  * Choose **Later** to schedule the stage at a later time relative to the time you start the workflow.
  * Choose **On or after a specific date & time** to schedule the stage to begin at a specific time.
9. Click **plus (+)** to add another step to your workflow.
10. Add additional flag changes you want to make.
11. Add another approval or schedule condition step to create another stage of the workflow.
12. When you have added all of your release steps to the workflow, click **Start workflow**.

LaunchDarkly now processes the workflow steps for you based on the timeline and actions that you defined.

## Viewing a workflow

There are two ways to view active workflows for a feature flag. You can use the progress bar or view the workflow details in a read-only view.

### Progress bar

To view the status of a workflow on the Targeting page:

1. Navigate to the flag dashboard and select the flag with the workflow you want to view. The flag's **Targeting** tab appears.
2. View active workflows listed at the top of the **Targeting** tab.

3. Click a stage bubble for more information on what actions are being taken in that stage.

### Workflow details

To view the workflow details:

1. Navigate to the flag dashboard and select the flag with the workflow you want to view.
2. Click the **Workflows** tab to view a list of all active workflows.
3. Click the name of the workflow you'd like to view.

## Deleting a workflow

Deleting a workflow stops any further stages from executing. It does not undo any changes that the workflow has already made.

To delete a workflow:

1. Navigate to the flag dashboard and select the flag with the workflow you want to view.
3. Click on the **Workflows** tab.
4. Click on the **overflow menu** next to the workflow you want to delete.
5. Select "Delete workflow."

6. Enter the flag name or key to confirm the deletion.
7. Click **delete**.

## Understanding permissions in workflows

A LaunchDarkly member must have permission to make flag changes to create workflows because workflows inherit permissions from flags. To learn more about how to configure the right permissions for members, read [Resources](/home/members/role-resources).
