## Overview

This topic explains how to use LaunchDarkly's approvals feature to request review for changes you plan to make to a flag. It also explains how to review an approval request when you are asked to.

You can customize an environment's approval settings in the **Projects** tab of the **Account settings** page. To learn more, read [Configuring approvals by environment](/home/managing-flags/feature-workflows/environment-approvals).

Approvals let more people have input on planned changes to a flag. These review-style approvals mimic common code review workflows, such as PR reviews in GitHub.

## Understanding approvals

When an account member plans a flag change, they have the option to request approval for that change from anyone in their LaunchDarkly project.

Anyone with a `writer`, `owner / admin`, or custom role can approve a flag change, regardless of whether or not their review has been requested. Account members who the requester chooses receive an email notifying them that their review has been requested, and, if applicable, a notification in the LaunchDarkly Slack app.

Here is an image of the approvals email notification from LaunchDarkly:

From that email, a requested approver can access a summary page of the flag changes and approve or decline the changes proposed.

To learn more about the Slack app, read [Slack](/integrations/slack).

## Requesting approval for a flag change

You can request approval on changes to a flag's targeting at any point after creation. You can also delete your own approval requests. To learn more, read [Deleting an approval request](#deleting-an-approval-request).

![The approval request.](approvals-approval-screen.png)

The only people you can request approval from are other members of your LaunchDarkly project. You can request approval from anyone in your project with approval permissions, up to a maximum of ten people.

Here's how:

1. Make the changes you wish to make to any flag.
2. Click the **dropdown icon** in the **Review and save** button. The additional actions menu appears:

<CalloutTitle>Your environment may require approvals</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

If your environment requires approvals, **Review and request approval** is the default option. To learn more, read [Configuring approvals by environment](/home/feature-workflows/environment-approvals).

3. Click "Request approval." The "Request approval" dialog appears. Members on an Enterprise plan also see the Schedule option.

4. Review and confirm the changes displayed in the dialog. If you need to make changes, click **Edit** next to the pencil icon.
5. Enter a **Description** to add context that helps your reviewers understand the changes you made.
6. Choose one or more reviewers from the **Reviewers** menu.
7. Click **Request approval**. The approval request appears.

You can choose reviewers that can approve your request, and members with a role that only allows them to view requests. The people you chose from the menu each receive an email, an inbox notification, and a Slack notification, if applicable, asking them to approve your flag changes.

The flag's **Targeting** tab also updates with a number next to the **Pending changes** icon to indicate that there are pending changes waiting for review.

## Reviewing flag approval requests

If someone requests your approval on a flag change, an in-app notification appears and you receive notifications in email and, if applicable, Slack. You can click through to view and approve or decline the request from any of these notifications.


To approve or decline a change from within the LaunchDarkly app:

1. Click the bell icon in the top menu bar. The approval notification inbox appears:

![The approval notification inbox with a new approval request.](approvals-approval-request-notification.png)

2. Click **View Details**. The approvals request screen opens:

![The approval request screen.](approvals-approval-screen.png)

3. Review the flag changes and choose to approve or decline the changes. You may optionally enter a comment in the **Add comment** box summarizing your decision.

  - If you want to approve and apply the changes right away, click **Approve and apply**. The "Review history" section updates to indicate that you reviewed the change request, and the requestor receives an email notification.

  - If you want to approve the changes but not apply them, click into the dropdown and choose **Approve changes**. The original requester, or any account member with a writer, owner / admin, or custom role can apply the changes you approved.

  - If you want to decline the changes, click **Decline changes**.

To approve or decline a change from an email notification:

1. Find the email from "The Team at LaunchDarkly" in your email client. The email subject includes name of the project, environment, and flag you're being asked to review and the phrase "Review request":

![The email notification from LaunchDarkly.](approvals-email.png)

2. In the message body, click **Review request** to open the approval request details.

3. Review the flag changes and choose to approve or decline the changes. Optionally, you may enter a comment that gives context for your decision in the **Add comment** box.

  - If you want to approve and apply the changes right away, click **Approve and apply**. The "Review history" section updates to indicate that you reviewed the change request, and the requestor receives an email notification.

  - If you want to approve the changes but not apply them, click into the dropdown and choose **Approve changes**. The original requester, or any account member with a writer, owner / admin, or custom role can apply the changes you approved.

  - If you want to deny the changes, click **Decline changes**.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Anyone with role access can leave a comment</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The requestor, anyone with a writer, owner / admin role, or anyone with a custom role that can review approval requests can comment on an approval request.

The only time someone with access cannot comment on an approval request is after the request has been applied. Applying an approval request freezes the approval request page to preserve the state it was in when the change was applied.

</CalloutDescription>

In addition to using the link in the email to access the approval request, you can view pending flag changes and approval requests in the "Pending changes" panel.

To access this panel, click the **Pending changes** icon on the flag's **Targeting** tab:

## Deleting an approval request

You may delete a request for changes to a flag at any point before the changes are applied. You can do this in two ways:

* from the "Pending changes" panel, or
* from the approval request.

### Deleting an approval request from the "Pending changes" panel

1. Navigate to the flag's **Targeting** tab and click the **Pending changes** icon. The "Pending changes" panel appears.
2. Find the change you wish to delete and click the **overflow menu**. Additional options appear:

3. Choose "Delete." A confirmation dialog appears.
4. Type the flag's name or key to confirm.
5. Click **Delete**. The request is deleted.

### Deleting an approval request from its page
