<CalloutTitle>For use in mobile, desktop, and embedded client applications only</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

This SDK is intended for use in single-user mobile, desktop, and embedded applications. It is intended for client-side (browser) feature flags only. If you have a Node.js application and want to set up LaunchDarkly on the server-side, read the [server-side Node.js SDK reference](/sdk/server-side/node-js).

To learn more about LaunchDarkly's different SDK types, read [Client-side and server-side SDKs](/sdk/concepts/client-side-server-side).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

This SDK does two things:

- Makes feature flags available to your client-side (front-end) JavaScript code.
- Sends `click`, `page view`, and `custom` events from your front-end for A/B tests and analytics.

The sample code snippets for this SDK are available in both JavaScript and TypeScript, where the sample code differs. To learn more, read [Using LaunchDarkly with TypeScript](https://launchdarkly.com/blog/using-launchdarkly-with-typescript/).

## Browser support

The LaunchDarkly client-side JavaScript SDK can be used in all major browsers. However, not all browsers have built-in support for the standard APIs that it uses. Those APIs are Promise, EventSource, and querySelectorAll. The SDK always requires Promise, but the other two are optional depending on which SDK features you use.

The standard solution for ensuring that you will get the same functionality even in browsers that do not have native support for these features is to use [polyfills](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Polyfill). For a detailed description, and links to information about which browsers may require this, read [JS SDK requirements and polyfills](/sdk/client-side/javascript/requirements-polyfills).

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Do Not Track and ad blocking software</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The JavaScript SDK respects the [Do Not Track events](https://www.eff.org/issues/do-not-track) header. If an end-user has Do Not Track enabled in their browser, the SDK does not send analytics events for flag evaluations or goals. In addition, ad-blocking software may block analytics events from being sent. This does not impact feature flag evaluations. To learn more about the events SDKs send to LaunchDarkly, read [Analytics events](/sdk/concepts/events). 

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

## Getting started

After you complete the [Getting started](/home/getting-started) process, follow these instructions to start using the LaunchDarkly SDK in your JavaScript code.

The first step is to make the LaunchDarkly SDK available as a dependency. There are two ways to make our JavaScript SDK available: as a module with a package manager, or with a `script` tag.

### Making the SDK available with a package manager

In most cases, making the LaunchDarkly SDK available to your application or site requires running one of the following in your project:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="npm"
  values={[
    { label: 'npm', value: 'npm', },
    { label: 'yarn', value: 'yarn', },
    { label: 'bower', value: 'bower', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="npm">

```bash
npm install launchdarkly-js-client-sdk
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn add launchdarkly-js-client-sdk
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="bower">

```bash
# LaunchDarkly's JS SDK script is copied from unpkg in this example
bower install https://unpkg.com/launchdarkly-js-client-sdk@2
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

If you are using a package manager, and combining dependencies with your code using a tool such as Webpack, there are various ways to import the LaunchDarkly SDK into your code.

Here are two examples in commonly used frameworks:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
// Using require()
const LDClient = require('launchdarkly-js-client-sdk');

// Using ES2015 imports
import * as LDClient from 'launchdarkly-js-client-sdk';

// Using TypeScript imports
import * as LDClient from 'launchdarkly-js-client-sdk';

```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

In earlier versions of the SDK, the package was named `ldclient-js` instead of `launchdarkly-js-client-sdk`.

### Making the SDK available with a script tag

To load our JavaScript SDK as a script tag, include one of the following in the `<head>` tag of your site on any pages where you need feature flags or want to track A/B testing goals.

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Do not use script tags from unpkg or jsDelivr in production</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

 The `script` tag in the self-hosted example below references a script which is deployed alongside other JavaScript resources in your application. We recommend that you use this method in production.

 Do not use script tags with sources from unpkg and jsDelivr in production environments. These introduce a critical dependency on a third-party service. The unpkg and jsDelivr scripts are intended to be used only for ease of development and getting started.

 In production environments, we strongly recommend that you self-host the LaunchDarkly SDK alongside your other JavaScript resources.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

If you are working in a development environment, you can load the SDK from unpkg or jsDelivr using the example code below. Replace the `<EXAMPLE-VERSION>` with your desired version. To learn more, read [Releases](https://github.com/launchdarkly/js-client-sdk/releases) in the [JavaScript SDK GitHub repository](https://github.com/launchdarkly/js-client-sdk). We recommend pinning to an exact SDK version if you are using a third-party hosting service.

Here is an example of code to include in the `<head>` tag of your site:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="self"
  values={[
    { label: 'Loading from a self-hosted script', value: 'self', },
    { label: 'Loading from unpkg', value: 'unpkg', },
    { label: 'Loading from jsDelivr', value: 'jsDelivr', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="self">

```html

<!-- recommended for production environments -->
<script src="path/to/ldclient.min.js"></script>

```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="unpkg">

```bash

<script crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://unpkg.com/launchdarkly-js-client-sdk@<EXAMPLE-VERSION>"></script>

```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="jsDelivr">

```bash

<script crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://cdn.jsDelivr.net/npm/launchdarkly-js-client-sdk@<EXAMPLE-VERSION>"></script>

```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## Initializing the client

After you install the dependency, initialize the LaunchDarkly client. To create a client instance, you need your environment's client-side ID, available in the Projects tab of your [Account settings page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/projects). Client-side IDs are not secret and you can expose them in your client-side code without risk. Never embed a server-side SDK key into a client-side application.

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>LDClient must be a singleton</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

It's important to make `LDClient` a singleton. The client instance maintains internal state that allows LaunchDarkly to serve feature flags without making any remote requests. Do not instantiate a new client with every request.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

In practice, you should templatize your client-side ID so that you can use the same initialization code when you switch between development, QA, and production environments.

Feature flag targeting and rollouts are determined by the user viewing the page. You must pass a user context to the SDK during initialization before requesting any feature flags with `variation`. If you fail to pass a valid user context to the SDK during initialization, you will receive a 400 error.

Here is an example showing how to initialize the client:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
    { label: 'TypeScript', value: 'ts'},
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
const user = {
  key: 'aa0ceb'
};
const client = LDClient.initialize('YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID', user);
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="ts">

```ts
const user: LDClient.LDUser = {
  key: 'aa0ceb'
};
const client = LDClient.initialize('YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID', user);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>


<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Initialization delay</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Initializing the client makes a remote request to LaunchDarkly, so it may take 100 milliseconds or more before the SDK emits the ready event. If you require feature flag values before rendering the page, we recommend bootstrapping the client. If you bootstrap the client, it will emit the ready event immediately. To learn more, read [Bootstrapping](/sdk/features/bootstrapping#javascript).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

To find out when the client is ready, you can use one of two mechanisms: events or promises.

The client object can emit JavaScript events. It emits a `ready` event when it receives initial flag values from LaunchDarkly. You can listen for this event to determine when the client is ready to evaluate flags.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
    { label: 'TypeScript', value: 'ts'},
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
client.on('ready', () => {
  // initialization succeeded, flag values are now available
  const flagValue = client.variation('YOUR_FEATURE_KEY', false);
  // etc.
});
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="ts">

```ts
client.on('ready', () => {
  // initialization succeeded, flag values are now available
  const boolFlagValue = client.variation('YOUR_FEATURE_KEY', false) as boolean;
  const numberFlagValue = client.variation('YOUR_FEATURE_KEY', 2) as number;
  const stringFlagValue = client.variation('YOUR_FEATURE_KEY', 'default') as string;
  // etc.
});
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Streaming Updates</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The SDK does not subscribe to streaming real-time updates automatically when you initialize it. This means subscribing to the SDK's `change` event by calling `.on('change').` causes the SDK to open a streaming connection to LaunchDarkly. This is the only way to receive realtime updates.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Or, you can use a promise instead of an event. The SDK has two methods that return a promise for initialization: `waitUntilReady()` and `waitForInitialization()`. The behavior of `waitUntilReady()` is equivalent to the `ready` event. The promise resolves when the client receives its initial flag data. As with all promises, you can either use `.then()` to provide a callback, or use `await` if you are writing asynchronous code.

Here is an example:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
client.waitUntilReady().then(() => {
  // initialization succeeded, flag values are now available
});

// or, with await:
await client.waitUntilReady();
// initialization succeeded, flag values are now available
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

The other method that returns a promise, `waitForInitialization()`, is similar to `waitUntilReady()` except that it also tells you if initialization fails by rejecting the promise. This method never rejects the `waitUntilReady()` promise.

Here is an example:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
client.waitForInitialization().then(() => {
  // initialization succeeded, flag values are now available
}).catch(err => {
  // initialization failed
});

// or, with await:
try {
  await client.waitForInitialization();
  // initialization succeeded, flag values are now available
} catch (err) {
  // initialization failed
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

The SDK only decides initialization has failed if it receives an error response indicating that the environment ID is invalid. If it has trouble connecting to LaunchDarkly, it will keep retrying until it succeeds.

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Making feature flags available to this SDK</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

You must make feature flags available to client-side SDKs before the SDK can evaluate those flags. If an SDK tries to evaluate a feature flag that is not available, the user will receive the default value for that flag.

To make a flag available to this SDK, check the **SDKs using Client-side ID** checkbox during flag creation, or on the flag's **Settings** tab. To make all of a project's flags available to this SDK by default, check the **SDKs using Client-side ID** checkbox in your project [Settings](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/projects).

Lastly, shut down the client when your application terminates. To learn more, read [Shutting down](/sdk/features/shutdown#javascript).
