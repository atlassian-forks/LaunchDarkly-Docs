## Overview

This topic documents how to get started with the client-side .NET SDK, and links to reference information on all of the supported features.

<Callout intent="primary">

<CalloutDescription>

LaunchDarkly's SDKs are open source. In addition to this reference guide, we provide source, API reference documentation, and sample applications:

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>For use in mobile, desktop, and embedded client applications only</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

This SDK is intended for use in single-user mobile, desktop, and embedded applications. If you have a .NET application and want to set up LaunchDarkly on the server-side, read the [server-side .NET SDK reference](/sdk/server-side/dotnet).

To learn more about LaunchDarkly's different SDK types, read [Client-side and server-side SDKs](/sdk/concepts/client-side-server-side).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>This SDK was previously named the Xamarin SDK</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Older versions of this SDK were named the LaunchDarkly Xamarin SDK, because Xamarin was the .NET-based platform for mobile devices. Because you can also use this SDK in desktop and embedded applications without Xamarin, we have renamed it.

Older versions were published with the NuGet package name `LaunchDarkly.XamarinSdk`. In all future releases, the package name is `LaunchDarkly.ClientSdk` instead.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

## Getting started

After you complete the [Getting started](/home/getting-started) process, follow these instructions to start using the LaunchDarkly SDK in your application.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>SDK version compatibility</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The LaunchDarkly client-side .NET SDK is compatible with Android SDK version 7.1 and higher and with iOS version 10.0 and higher.

It is also compatible with any other platform that supports .NET Standard version 1.6 or higher, although the .NET Standard version lacks some mobile-specific features such as detecting network connectivity. Previous beta releases of the LaunchDarkly client-side .NET SDK used the Xamarin.Essentials library, but the SDK no longer has that dependency.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

To start using the client-side .NET SDK:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="csharp"
  values={[
    { label: 'Example', value: 'csharp', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="csharp">

```csharp
Install-Package LaunchDarkly.ClientSdk
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Next, import the LaunchDarkly packages in your application code:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="csharp"
  values={[
    { label: 'Example', value: 'csharp', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="csharp">

```csharp
using LaunchDarkly.Sdk;
using LaunchDarkly.Sdk.Client;

// LaunchDarkly.Sdk defines general types like User, which are also used in the server-side .NET SDK.
// LaunchDarkly.Sdk.Client defines the LdClient and Configuration types for the client-side .NET SDK.
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

After you install the dependency, initialize the LaunchDarkly client by creating a single, shared instance of `LdClient`. To create a client instance, you need your environment's mobile key. This authorizes your application to connect to a particular environment within LaunchDarkly. Your mobile key is available in the Projects tab of your [Account settings page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/projects). Mobile keys are not secret and you can expose them in your client-side code without risk. Never embed a server-side SDK key into a client-side application.

The following example shows the simplest way to create the client. It blocks for up to one second until it retrieves the latest feature flags from LaunchDarkly.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="csharp"
  values={[
    { label: 'Example', value: 'csharp', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="csharp">

```csharp
var user = User.WithKey(user_key);
var timeSpan = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10);
client = LdClient.Init("MY_MOBILE_KEY", user, timeSpan);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

However, calling blocking code from the main thread in a mobile app is not considered a best practice. The preferred method is to load the client asynchronously.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="csharp"
  values={[
    { label: 'Example', value: 'csharp', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="csharp">

```csharp
User user = User.WithKey(user_key);
client = await LdClient.InitAsync("MY_MOBILE_KEY", user);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>LdClient must be a singleton</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

It's important to make `LdClient` a singleton. The client instance maintains internal state that allows LaunchDarkly to serve feature flags without making any remote requests. Do not instantiate a new client with every request.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Android requires AccessNetworkState permission</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Android requires the `AccessNetworkState` permission and you must configure it in the Android project. To learn more about how to implement this requirement, read Microsoft's [Xamarin documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/essentials/connectivity?context=xamarin%2Fios&tabs=android).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

You can use `client` to check which variation a particular user will receive for a given feature flag.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="csharp"
  values={[
    { label: 'Example', value: 'csharp', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="csharp">

```csharp
bool showFeature = client.BoolVariation("your.feature.key", false);
if (showFeature) {
    // Application code to show the feature
}
else {
    // The code to run if the feature is off
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Making feature flags available to this SDK</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

You must make feature flags available to mobile SDKs before the SDK can evaluate those flags. If an SDK tries to evaluate a feature flag that is not available, the user will receive the default value for that flag.

To make a flag available to this SDK, check the **SDKs using Mobile key** checkbox during flag creation, or on the flag's Settings tab. To make all of a project's flags available to this SDK by default, check the **SDKs using Mobile key** checkbox in your project [Settings](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/projects).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

## Using the Relay Proxy

You can configure the client-side .NET SDK to connect to the [Relay Proxy](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-relay) as follows:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="csharp"
  values={[
    { label: 'Example', value: 'csharp', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="csharp">

```csharp
Configuration config = Configuration.Builder("YOUR_SDK_KEY")
    .ServiceEndpoints(
        Components.ServiceEndpoints().RelayProxy("YOUR_RELAY_URI")
    )
    .Build();
LdClient client = LdClient.Init(config);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## Shutting down

Shut down the client when your application terminates. To learn more, read [Shutting down](/sdk/features/shutdown#net-client-side).
