## Overview

This topic documents how to get started with the Go SDK, and links to reference information on all of the supported features.

<Callout intent="primary">

<CalloutDescription>

LaunchDarkly's SDKs are open source. In addition to this reference guide, we provide source, API reference documentation, and a sample application:

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>SDK version compatibility</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The LaunchDarkly Go SDK, version 5.0 and higher, is compatible with Go 1.14 and higher.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

## Getting started

After you complete the [Getting Started process](/home/getting-started), follow these instructions to start using the LaunchDarkly SDK in your Go application.

First, install the LaunchDarkly SDK as a dependency in your application. How you do this depends on what dependency management system you are using:

* If you are using the standard [Go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) system, import the SDK packages in your code and `go build` will automatically download them. The SDK and its dependencies are modules.
* If you are using `dep`, import the SDK packages in your code and run `dep ensure`.
* Otherwise, use the `go get` command and specify the SDK version, such as `go get gopkg.in/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk.v5`.

There are several packages that you can import, depending on which features you are using. You usually need the following:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="go"
  values={[
    { label: 'Go', value: 'go', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="go">

```go
import (
    // go-sdk-common.v2/lduser defines LaunchDarkly's model for user properties
    "gopkg.in/launchdarkly/go-sdk-common.v2/lduser"

    // go-server-sdk.v5 is the main SDK package - here we are aliasing it to "ld"
    ld "gopkg.in/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk.v5"

    // go-server-sdk.v5/ldcomponents is for advanced configuration options
    "gopkg.in/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk.v5/ldcomponents"
)
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

It is good practice to pin your dependencies to a specific version. Refer to the [SDK releases page](https://github.com/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk/releases) to identify the latest version. When you update your version of `go-server-sdk`, you should also update `go-sdk-common`.

After you install and import the SDK, create a single, shared instance of [`LDClient`](https://pkg.go.dev/gopkg.in/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk.v5#LDClient). Specify your SDK key here to authorize your application to connect to a particular environment within LaunchDarkly.

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>LDClient must be a singleton</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

It's important to make `LDClient` a singleton. The client instance maintains internal state that allows LaunchDarkly to serve feature flags without making any remote requests. Do not instantiate a new client with every request.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

This example assumes you've imported the LaunchDarkly SDK package as `ld`, as shown above.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="go"
  values={[
    { label: 'Go', value: 'go', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="go">

```go
client, _ := ld.MakeClient("YOUR_SDK_KEY", 5 * time.Second)
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

The second argument to `MakeClient` is a timeout parameter. In this example, you are telling the SDK that it can spend up to five seconds attempting to connect to LaunchDarkly services before returning to your application. For more details about what the timeout means and what happens if initialization fails, read [`MakeClient`](https://pkg.go.dev/gopkg.in/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk.v5#MakeClient).

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Best practices for error handling</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The second return type in these code samples ( `_` ) represents an error in case the LaunchDarkly client does not initialize. Consider naming the return value and using it with proper error handling.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Using the `LDClient` methods, you can check which variation a particular user should receive for a given feature flag. To learn more, read [Evaluating flags](/sdk/features/evaluating) and [Flag evaluation reasons](/sdk/features/evaluation-reasons). For more information about how user properties are specified, read [User configuration](/sdk/features/user-config).

In this example, the user key is an email address:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="go"
  values={[
    { label: 'Go', value: 'go', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="go">

```go
import (
    "gopkg.in/launchdarkly/go-sdk-common.v2/lduser"
)

flagKey := "some-flag-key"
user := lduser.NewUser("some-user-key")
showFeature, _ := client.BoolVariation(flagKey, user, false)
if showFeature {
    // Application code to show the feature
} else {
    // The code to run if the feature is off
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## HTTPS Proxy

Go's standard HTTP library provides a built-in HTTPS proxy. If the `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variable is present, then the SDK will proxy all network requests through the URL provided.

Here is an example:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="linux"
  values={[
    { label: 'command line - on Mac or Linux', value: 'linux', },
    { label: 'command line - on Windows', value: 'windows', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="linux">

```bash
export HTTPS_PROXY=https://web-proxy.domain.com:8080
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="windows">

```
set HTTPS_PROXY=https://web-proxy.domain.com:8080
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

You can also specify a proxy programmatically through the SDK configuration:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="go"
  values={[
    { label: 'Go', value: 'go', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="go">

```go
import (
    ld "gopkg.in/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk.v5"
    "gopkg.in/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk.v5/ldcomponents"
)

var config ld.Config
config.HTTP = ldcomponents.HTTPConfiguration().
    ProxyURL("https://web-proxy.domain.com:8080")
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## Shutting down

Lastly, shut down the client when your application terminates. To learn more, read [Shutting down](/sdk/features/shutdown#go).
