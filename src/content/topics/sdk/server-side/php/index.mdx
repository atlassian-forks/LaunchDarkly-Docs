## Overview

This topic documents how to get started with the PHP SDK, and links to reference information on all of the supported features.

<Callout intent="primary">

<CalloutDescription>

LaunchDarkly's SDKs are open source. In addition to this reference guide, we provide source, API reference documentation, and a sample application:

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>SDK version compatibility</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The LaunchDarkly PHP SDK, version 4.0 and higher, is compatible with PHP 7.3 and higher.

If you need support for older versions of PHP, use version 3.x of the LaunchDarkly PHP SDK.

## Getting started

After you complete the [Getting Started process](/home/getting-started), follow these instructions to start using the LaunchDarkly SDK in your PHP application.

The first step is to install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and the LaunchDarkly SDK as a dependency in your application. Refer to the [SDK releases page](https://github.com/launchdarkly/php-server-sdk/releases) to identify the latest version if you want to depend on a specific version.

To install Composer:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="php"
  values={[
    { label: 'Shell', value: 'php', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="php">

```bash
php composer.phar require launchdarkly/server-sdk

# In earlier versions, this was "launchdarkly/launchdarkly-php"
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Then require Composer's autoloader:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="php"
  values={[
    { label: 'PHP', value: 'php', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="php">

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

After you install and import the SDK, create a single, shared instance of [`LDClient`](http://launchdarkly.github.io/php-server-sdk/classes/LaunchDarkly-LDClient.html). Specify your SDK key here to authorize your application to connect to a particular environment within LaunchDarkly.

Only create one instance of `client`.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="php"
  values={[
    { label: 'PHP', value: 'php', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="php">

```php
$client = new LaunchDarkly\LDClient("YOUR_SDK_KEY");
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

You can use `$client` to check which variation a particular user will receive for a given feature flag.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="php"
  values={[
    { label: 'PHP', value: 'php', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="php">

```php
$user = new LaunchDarkly\LDUser("user@test.com");

if ($client->variation("your.flag.key", $user)) {
    // application code to show the feature
} else {
    // the code to run if the feature is off
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

In our [Getting Started guide](/home/getting-started) we recommend that users shut down the LaunchDarkly client on application termination. This step does not exist in PHP because the PHP SDK does not maintain long-lived network connections nor an event queue.

## Fetching flags

There are two distinct methods of integrating LaunchDarkly in a PHP environment:

- [The Relay Proxy](/home/relay-proxy) retrieves and store flags in [Redis](/sdk/features/storing-data/redis), [DynamoDB](/sdk/features/storing-data/dynamodb), or [Consul](/sdk/features/storing-data/consul). This is the recommended method.
- [Guzzle Cache Middleware](https://github.com/Kevinrob/guzzle-cache-middleware) requests and caches HTTP responses in an in-memory array. This is the default method.

We strongly suggest using the Relay Proxy. Per-flag caching mode using Guzzle is only intended for low-throughput environments.

## Using the Relay Proxy

PHP's shared-nothing architecture prevents LaunchDarkly from reusing the streaming API connection across requests.

You can use PHP without the Relay Proxy, but we strongly recommend using the Relay Proxy in **daemon mode** if you are using PHP in a high-throughput setting. This makes the Relay Proxy receive feature flag updates.

To learn more, read [Using the Relay Proxy in different modes](/home/relay-proxy/using#using-the-relay-proxy-in-different-modes).

## Using Guzzle

For the latest major version of the PHP SDK, use open-ended dependencies. For older versions, refer to your version's composer.json file.

To require Guzzle as a dependency:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="php"
  values={[
    { label: 'PHP', value: 'php', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="php">

```php
php composer.phar require "guzzlehttp/guzzle:^6.3.0"
php composer.phar require "kevinrob/guzzle-cache-middleware:^1.4.0"
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Guzzle is then used to fetch flags. You can persist your cache somewhere other than the default in-memory store, like Memcached or Redis.

You can then specify your cache when initializing the client with the cache option:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="php"
  values={[
    { label: 'PHP', value: 'php', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="php">

```php
$client = new LaunchDarkly\LDClient("YOUR_SDK_KEY", array("cache" => $cacheStorage));
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>
