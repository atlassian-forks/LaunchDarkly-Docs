## Overview

This topic explains how to use the flag evaluation reason feature to get more information about the flag variations LaunchDarkly serves to users.

To learn more about how LaunchDarkly determines why a user receives a given flag variation, read [Evaluation reasons](/sdk/concepts/evaluation-reasons).

## Understanding the flag evaluation reason feature

Details about each SDK's configuration are available in the SDK-specific sections below.

* [Client-side SDKs](#client-side-sdks)
* [Server-side SDKs](#server-side-sdks)

## Client-side SDKs

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>An evaluation reason configuration option is required</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

In client-side SDKs, you must enable an evaluation reason configuration option for this feature to work. To learn more about configuration options, read [Configuration](/sdk/features/config).

This feature is available in the following client-side SDKs:

* [.NET (client-side)](#net-client-side)
* [Android](#android)

### .NET (client-side)

<Details summary="Expand .NET (client-side) code sample">

The `VariationDetail` methods, such as `BoolVariationDetail`, work the same as `Variation`, but also provide additional "reason" information about how a flag value was calculated. For example, you can find out if the user was individually targeted for the flag or was matched by one of the flag's rules. You can examine the "reason" data programmatically, or, if you capture detailed analytics events for flags, view it with Data Export.

Here is an example:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="csharp"
  values={[
    { label: 'C#', value: 'csharp', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="csharp">

```csharp

EvaluationDetail<bool> detail =
  client.BoolVariationDetail("flag-key", false);
  // or StringVariationDetail for a string-valued flag, etc.

bool value = detail.Value;
int? index = detail.VariationIndex;
EvaluationReason reason = detail.Reason;
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

To learn more, read [`EvaluationDetail`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/dotnet-client-sdk/api/LaunchDarkly.Sdk.EvaluationDetail-1.html) and [`BoolVariationDetail`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/dotnet-client-sdk/api/LaunchDarkly.Sdk.Client.LdClient.html#LaunchDarkly_Sdk_Client_LdClient_BoolVariationDetail_).

### iOS

<Details summary="Expand iOS code sample">

The `variationDetail` methods, such as `boolVariationDetail`, work the same as `variation`. They also provide additional "reason" information about how a flag value was calculated, such as if the user matched a specific rule. You can examine the "reason" data programmatically, or, if you capture detailed analytics events for flags, view it with Data Export.

</Details>

### JavaScript

<Details summary="Expand JavaScript code sample">

The `variationDetail` method lets you evaluate a feature flag with the same parameters you would for `variation`. With `variationDetail`, you receive more information about how the value was calculated.

The variation detail returns in an object containing both the result value and a "reason" object which tells you more information about the flag evaluation. For example, you can find out if the user was individually targeted for the flag or was matched by one of the flag's rules. It also indicates if the flag returned the default value due to an error. You can examine the "reason" data programmatically, or, if you capture detailed analytics events for flags, view it with Data Export.

Here is an example:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js

const detail = client.variationDetail('flag-key', false);

const value = detail.value;
const index = detail.variationIndex;
const reason = detail.reason;
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

You must set `evaluationReasons` to `true` for the SDK to send variation details. To learn more, read [`LDEvaluationDetail`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/js-client-sdk/interfaces/_launchdarkly_js_client_sdk_.ldevaluationdetail.html) and [`variationDetail`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/js-client-sdk/interfaces/_launchdarkly_js_client_sdk_.ldclient.html#variationdetail).

### React Native

<Details summary="Expand React Native code sample">

The `variationDetail` methods work the same as `variation`, but also provide additional `reason` information about how a flag value was calculated. For example, you can find out if the user was individually targeted for the flag or was matched by one of the flag's rules. You can examine the "reason" data programmatically, or, if you capture detailed analytics events for flags, view it with Data Export.

const index = detail.variationIndex;
const reason = detail.reason;
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

To learn more, read [`LDEvaluationDetail`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/react-native-client-sdk/index.html#LDEvaluationDetail) and [`boolVariationDetail`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/react-native-client-sdk/classes/LDClient.html#boolVariationDetail).
</Details>

### Roku

<Details summary="Expand Roku code sample">

For each variation type there is also an associated version that returns the reason a particular value was returned.

Here is an example:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="brightscript"
  values={[
    { label: 'BrightScript', value: 'brightscript', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="brightscript">

```brightscript
details = launchDarkly.intVariationDetail("MY_FLAG_KEY", 123)

```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

These variation methods return an object containing the keys `value`, `reason`, and `variationIndex`. The `value` field is the result of the evaluation. The `reason` field is an object that explains why the result happened, for example details about a rule match. The reason object will always contain a `kind` field. Lastly the `variationIndex` field contains the ID of the particular value returned. This field may be null.
</Details>

## Server-side SDKs

Unlike client-side SDKs, you do not need to enable an evaluation reason configuration option in server-side SDKs for this feature to work.

This feature is available in the following server-side SDKs:

### Apex

<Details summary="Expand Apex code sample">

By passing an `LDClient.EvaluationDetail` object to a variation call you can programmatically inspect the reason for a particular evaluation.

Here is an example:

<CodeTabs

    /* ... */
}
```

</CodeTabItem>

</Details>

### C/C++ (server-side)

<Details summary="Expand C/C++ (server-side) code sample">

  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="c">

```c
struct LDDetails details;
bool value = LDBoolVariation(client, user, "your.feature.key", false, &details);

// or StringVariationDetail for a string-valued flag, etc.

index := detail.VariationIndex

// In Go SDK 5.0 and higher, detail.VariationIndex uses the type ldvalue.OptionalInt, which
// allows an "undefined" state if evaluation failed. In earlier Go SDK versions, it is an
// *int which is nil if evaluation failed.
