## Overview

This topic explains how the bootstrapping feature works in the LaunchDarkly SDKs that support it.

## Understanding the bootstrapping feature

The bootstrapping feature lets you decrease startup times for client-side SDKs by providing them with an initial set of flag values. The SDK serves these values to the user while it initializes, before it has established a connection to LaunchDarkly. The SDK makes an initial call to LaunchDarkly to check for updated flag values, but this happens in the background. The user experiences no inconsistency in which flag variations they see.

This feature is available in the following client-side SDKs:

* [Electron](#electron)
* [JavaScript](#javascript)
* [Node.js](#nodejs-client-side)
* [React](#react)

### Electron

The bootstrap feature in Electron works the same as in client-side Node.js SDK. To learn how to use it, read [Node.js (client-side)](#nodejs-client-side).

If you set `bootstrap` to the string `"localStorage"`, the client tries to get flag values from persistent storage, using a unique key that is based on the user properties. In Electron, persistent storage consists of files in the [`userData`](https://electronjs.org/docs/) directory. If the client finds flag values stored for this user, it uses them and starts up immediately in a ready state, but also makes a background request to LaunchDarkly to get the latest values and stores them as soon as it receives them.

### JavaScript

We recommend populating bootstrap values with a JSON object containing flag metadata derived from calling the server-side SDK's "allFlagsState" method. All of the server-side SDKs have a function, called some variation of "allFlagsState," to evaluate flags on behalf of a specified user. This function provides the initial set of bootstrap values to your front end. The exact name varies depending on the back-end technology's naming conventions, such as camel-case or snake-case.

If your backend passes values to your front end on pageload, you can call your server-side SDK's `allFlagsState` function on pageload and pass the results as a parameter to your front-end initialization code.

Here is an example of how to bootstrap flags into the JavaScript client, if it passes the flags on pageload:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: "js" },
    { label: 'TypeScript', value: "ts" },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
function onPageLoad(flags) {
  ...

  const client = LDClient.initialize(
    'YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID',
    user,
    options = {
      bootstrap: flags
    }
  );

  ...
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="ts">

```ts
import * as LDClient from 'launchdarkly-js-client-sdk';

function onPageLoad(flags: LDClient.LDFlagSet) {
  ...
  const user: LDClient.LDUser = { key: 'aa0ceb'}
  const options: LDClient.LDOptions = { bootstrap: flags };
  const client = LDClient.initialize('YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID', user, options);
  ...
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

If you can invoke your backend dynamically, such as in Ruby with a template directory, you can inline the function invocation and request that the SDK return only the client-side flags.

Here is an example of how to bootstrap flags into the JavaScript client, if you acquire the flags from a Ruby template directive:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: "js" },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
const ldclient = LDClient.initialize(
  'YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID',
  user,
  options = {
    // Load values from a Ruby template directive
    bootstrap: {{
      client.all_flags_state(user, {client_side_only: true})
    }}
  }
);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

If you bootstrap from the server-side, feature flags are ready immediately, and clients always receive the latest feature flag values. For a demonstration of server-side bootstrapping, visit this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/launchdarkly/hello-bootstrap).

Alternatively, you can bootstrap feature flags from local storage:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
    { label: 'TypeScript', value: 'ts'},
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
const client = LDClient.initialize('YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID', user, options = {
  bootstrap: 'localStorage'
});
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="ts">

```ts
import * as LDClient from 'launchdarkly-js-client-sdk';

const options: LDClient.LDOptions = { bootstrap: 'localStorage' };
const client = LDClient.initialize('YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID', user, options);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

When it uses local storage, the client stores the latest flag settings there. On page load, it uses the previous settings and the 'ready' event is emitted immediately. This means that on page load, the user may see cached flag values until the next page load.

You can still subscribe to flag changes if you use local storage.

### Node.js (client-side)

You can use bootstrapping on the Node.js SDK with values provided by LaunchDarkly-enabled code on the backend.

You can use it to set the feature flags to any values you want:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
    { label: 'TypeScript', value: 'ts', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
const client = LaunchDarkly.initialize(
  'YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID',
  user,
  {
    bootstrap: {
      flagKey1: flagValue1,
      flagKey2: flagValue2
    }
  }
);
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="ts">

```ts
import * as LaunchDarkly from 'launchdarkly-node-client-sdk';

const options: LaunchDarkly.LDOptions = {
  bootstrap: {
    flagKey1: flagValue1,
    flagKey2: flagValue2,
  },
};

const client = LaunchDarkly.initialize('YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID', user, options);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

A more useful mode in a client-side Node application is to bootstrap from locally cached values. In this mode, if no values have been cached yet, the SDK obtains flags from LaunchDarkly and then caches them in persistent storage. The next time you start, the cached flags are immediately available, and the SDK also contacts LaunchDarkly in the background to obtain updated values.

To activate this mode, use the special string `"localStorage"`:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
    { label: 'TypeScript', value: 'ts', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
const client = LaunchDarkly.initialize(
  'YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID',
  user,
  {
    bootstrap: 'localStorage'
  }
);
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="ts">

```ts
import * as LaunchDarkly from 'launchdarkly-node-client-sdk';

const options: LaunchDarkly.LDOptions = { bootstrap: 'localStorage' };

const client = LaunchDarkly.initialize('YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID', user, options);

```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### React

You can use the optional `flags` property to bootstrap the React SDK.

If `flags` is specified, the React SDK only subscribes for updates to these flags. When this property is unspecified, the React SDK subscribes to all flags. This property is optional.

Specify the `flags` property as a JSON object containing flag metadata derived from calling the server-side SDK's `allFlagsState` method. The flag keys must be in their original form, as known to LaunchDarkly, rather than in their camel-cased form. Each flag's value is passed along to the resulting JavaScript SDK [`variation`](/sdk/features/evaluating) invocation and used as the flag's default value in the case of an error.

Here is an example:

<CodeTabs
defaultValue="json"
values={[
  { label: 'json', value: 'json', },
]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="json">

```json
{
  "flags": {
    "my-bool-flag": true,
    "my-int-flag": 5
  }
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>
